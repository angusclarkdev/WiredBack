      <h3 class="subtitle">New Horizons</h3>
      <p class="content"> Uncertainty creates opportunity. Fortunately, G20 countries are enjoying the fastest rate of growth in world trade since 2011. While still short of pre-credit crunch levels, this shows real potential for mid-term to longer-term growth. This is increasing
        demand for (re)insurance products, particularly in re-emerging markets and territories that require a range of specialist insurance solutions for large, state led infrastructure investment programmes. We source Alternative Risk Transfer (ART)
        products from A or AA rated insurers which can provide cross border sovereign and sub-sovereign non-repayment default obligation. Products which underpin and guarantee any definable asset receivable that is date certain of creating future value!
        Our alliance partner Transaction Mercantile are experts in financial logistics and can arrange project funding from UK/EU AAA rated banks. Demand for (re)insurance products, particularly in re-emerging markets and territories that require a range
        of specialist insurance solutions for large, state led infrastructure investment programmes.</p>

      <p class="content"> We offer our clients a fully regulated digital distribution platform with European Economic Area (EEA) passport permissions, sourcing a range of business and management liability products such as Cyber Liability, Crime and Fraud, Professional Indemnity
        and Directors and Officers Liability to our broad distribution network of affinity partners, associations and brokers. Distributed computing and data analytics, combined with machine learning algorithms, is providing the capability for personalised
        micro-insurance products to be tailored to individual need, and delivered via any device. Technology is forcing a complete re-design of the insurance disruption model, and despite the perceived, some might say, traditional view held of our industry,
        we are quite well connected with actual disruptive technology providers who offer breakthrough distribution models utilising data analytics and artificial intelligence (AIR/RPA) delivered to any personal internet connected device. </p>
